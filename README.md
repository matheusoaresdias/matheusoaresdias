**Hi, how are you?**

Hi, I'm Matheus Soares. I'm a web developer from Brazil, and I'm all about building great things on both the front-end (HTML5, CSS3, TypeScript, Tailwind, and React) and the back-end (Node.js, TypeScript, Nest.js, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB).

My journey has also led me into the cloud, where I enjoy working with services on both AWS and Azure. I love architecting solutions that are not just functional, but also resilient and scalable. This includes applying principles like load balancing for distributing traffic, and implementing circuit breakers to prevent system failures from cascading. I also have a strong focus on CI/CD, automating the path from code to production to ensure a fast and reliable delivery process.

I'm a lover of knowledge and imagination, and my passion is solving problems and taking on new challenges.

- :books: Philosophy lover and fond of learning new things.
